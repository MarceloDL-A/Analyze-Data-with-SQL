QUERIES
Review
Congratulations!

We just learned how to query data from a database using SQL. We also learned how to filter queries to make the information more specific and useful.

Let’s summarize:

SELECT is the clause we use every time we want to query information from a database.
AS renames a column or table.
DISTINCT return unique values.
WHERE is a popular command that lets you filter the results of the query based on conditions that you specify.
LIKE and BETWEEN are special operators.
AND and OR combines multiple conditions.
ORDER BY sorts the result.
LIMIT specifies the maximum number of rows that the query will return.
CASE creates different outputs.
Instructions
Feel free to experiment a bit more with the movies table before moving on!
