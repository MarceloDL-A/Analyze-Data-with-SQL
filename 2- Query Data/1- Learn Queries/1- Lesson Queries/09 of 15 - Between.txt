QUERIES
Between
The BETWEEN operator is used in a WHERE clause to filter the result set within a certain range. It accepts two values that are either numbers, text or dates.

For example, this statement filters the result set to only include movies with years from 1990 up to, and including 1999.

SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE year BETWEEN 1990 AND 1999;
When the values are text, BETWEEN filters the result set for within the alphabetical range.

In this statement, BETWEEN filters the result set to only include movies with names that begin with the letter ‘A’ up to, but not including ones that begin with ‘J’.

SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE name BETWEEN 'A' AND 'J';
However, if a movie has a name of simply ‘J’, it would actually match. This is because BETWEEN goes up to the second value — up to ‘J’. So the movie named ‘J’ would be included in the result set but not ‘Jaws’.

Instructions
1.
Using the BETWEEN operator, write a query that selects all information about movies whose name begins with the letters ‘D’, ‘E’, and ‘F’.

Checkpoint 2 Passed

Hint
This should be very similar to the second query in the narrative.

BETWEEN 'D' AND 'G' should be the condition:

SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE name BETWEEN 'D' AND 'G';
This will return all the names that begin with ‘D’, ‘E’, and ‘F’.

BETWEEN 'D' AND 'F' should not be the condition because it would return names that begin with ‘D’ and ‘E’, but not ‘F’ (unless there was a movie with the single letter name of “F”).

And don’t forget to capitalize D and G!

BETWEEN is case-sensitive. If the condition is BETWEEN 'a' AND 'z', it would only return lowercase (a-z) results and not uppercase (A-Z).

2.
Remove the previous query.

Using the BETWEEN operator, write a new query that selects all information about movies that were released in the 1970’s.

Checkpoint 3 Passed

Hint
In this statement, the BETWEEN operator is being used to filter the result set to only include movies with years in 1970-1979:

SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE year BETWEEN 1970 AND 1979;
Remember, BETWEEN two numbers is inclusive of the second number.

Notice that there is a movie from 1979 in the result.

Also, numeric values (INTEGER or REAL data types) don’t need to be wrapped with single quotes, whereas TEXT values do.

In SQL, when applying the BETWEEN operator on a range of TEXT values, each value must be compared somehow to be ordered correctly. What kind of comparison is done on TEXT values?
