QUERIES
Or
Similar to AND, the OR operator can also be used to combine multiple conditions in WHERE, but there is a fundamental difference:

AND operator displays a row if all the conditions are true.
OR operator displays a row if any condition is true.
Suppose we want to check out a new movie or something action-packed:

SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE year > 2014
   OR genre = 'action';
year > 2014 is the 1st condition.

genre = 'action' is the 2nd condition.

OR combines the two conditions.

With OR, if any of the conditions are true, then the row is added to the result.

Instructions
1.
Let’s test this out:

SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE year > 2014
   OR genre = 'action';
Checkpoint 2 Passed

Hint
This retrieves all the movies released after 2014 or in the action genre.

We are putting OR genre = 'action' on another line and indented just so it is easier to read.

2.
Suppose we are in the mood for a good laugh or a good cry.

Using OR, write a query that returns all movies that are either a romance or a comedy.

Checkpoint 3 Passed

Hint
What are the two conditions?

genre = 'romance'
genre = 'comedy'
So your query should look like:

SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE genre = 'romance'
   OR genre = 'comedy';
We indented and placed OR genre = 'comedy' on another line just so it is easier to read.

Are there any good romantic comedies in the list?
