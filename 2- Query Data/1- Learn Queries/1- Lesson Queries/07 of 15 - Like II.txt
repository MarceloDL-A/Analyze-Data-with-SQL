The percentage sign % is another wildcard character that can be used with LIKE.

This statement below filters the result set to only include movies with names that begin with the letter ‘A’:

SELECT * 
FROM movies
WHERE name LIKE 'A%';
% is a wildcard character that matches zero or more missing letters in the pattern. For example:

A% matches all movies with names that begin with letter ‘A’
%a matches all movies that end with ‘a’
We can also use % both before and after a pattern:

SELECT * 
FROM movies 
WHERE name LIKE '%man%';
Here, any movie that contains the word ‘man’ in its name will be returned in the result.

LIKE is not case sensitive. ‘Batman’ and ‘Man of Steel’ will both appear in the result of the query above.

Instructions
1.
In the text editor, type:

SELECT * 
FROM movies
WHERE name LIKE '%man%';
How many movie titles contain the word ‘man’?

Checkpoint 2 Passed

Hint
There are 12 movie titles that contain ‘man’.

Secret level!

What are the different use cases of the LIKE operator?

LIKE c% finds any values that start with the letter ‘c’
LIKE %c finds any values that end with the letter ‘c’
LIKE %re% finds values that have ‘re’ in any position
LIKE _a% finds any values that have the letter ‘a’ in the second index
LIKE a_%_% finds any values that start with ‘a’ and are at least 3 characters in length.
LIKE a%r finds any values that start with ‘a’ and end with ‘r’.
2.
Let’s try one more.

Edit the query so that it selects all the information about the movie titles that begin with the word ‘The’.

You might need a space in there!

Checkpoint 3 Passed

Hint
The condition should be name LIKE 'The %':

SELECT * 
FROM movies
WHERE name LIKE 'The %';
Notice how the % comes after The.

There is also a space in between because we don’t want words like ‘There’, ‘They’, etc.
