Is Null
By this point of the lesson, you might have noticed that there are a few missing values in the movies table. More often than not, the data you encounter will have missing values.

Unknown values are indicated by NULL.

It is not possible to test for NULL values with comparison operators, such as = and !=.

Instead, we will have to use these operators:

IS NULL
IS NOT NULL
To filter for all movies with an IMDb rating:

SELECT name
FROM movies 
WHERE imdb_rating IS NOT NULL;
Instructions
1.
Now let’s do the opposite.

Write a query to find all the movies without an IMDb rating.

Select only the name column!

Checkpoint 2 Passed

Hint
We want to query for movies that have a missing value in their imdb_rating field:

SELECT name
FROM movies
WHERE imdb_rating IS NULL;
Notice how we used IS NULL instead of IS NOT NULL here.
