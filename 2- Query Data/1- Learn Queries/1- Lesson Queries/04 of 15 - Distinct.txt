QUERIES
Distinct
When we are examining data in a table, it can be helpful to know what distinct values exist in a particular column.

DISTINCT is used to return unique values in the output. It filters out all duplicate values in the specified column(s).

For instance,

SELECT tools 
FROM inventory;
might produce:

tools
Hammer
Nails
Nails
Nails

By adding DISTINCT before the column name,

SELECT DISTINCT tools 
FROM inventory;
the result would now be:

tools
Hammer
Nails

Filtering the results of a query is an important skill in SQL. It is easier to see the different possible genres in the movie table after the data has been filtered than to scan every row in the table.

Instructions
1.
Let’s try it out. In the code editor, type:

SELECT DISTINCT genre 
FROM movies;
What are the unique genres?

Checkpoint 2 Passed

Hint
The different genres are:

action
comedy
horror
romance
drama
∅
The empty set symbol ∅ is just an empty value. DISTINCT recognize empty values, too.

2.
Now, change the code so we return the unique values of the year column instead.

Checkpoint 3 Passed

Hint
Suppose we only want to query the distinct results from a column. We will use the syntax:

SELECT DISTINCT column
FROM table_name;
Following this format, the code below returns the unique values of the year column:

SELECT DISTINCT year 
FROM movies;
In the result, there should only be one column with all the distinct years.

Note: You might’ve noticed how there appears to be an empty set symbol ∅ near the bottom of the results (right below 1987 and above 2017). It is not a bug! DISTINCT recognize empty values, too.
