CODE CHALLENGE: QUERIES
Code Challenge 9
The news table has the following columns:

id - the article identifier
title - the article title
publisher - the article publisher
category - the article category
timestamp - the time of publication
url - the article web address
Click here for the table diagram.

Instructions
1.
The category column contains the article category:

'b' stands for Business
't' stands for Technology
What are the 20 business articles published most recently?

Select all the columns.

Checkpoint 2 Passed

Hint
First, we filter our results to category = 'b' using a WHERE statement:

SELECT *
FROM news
WHERE category = 'b';
Then, we sort the entries by the most recent timestamp. We use DESC so that the most recent comes first:

SELECT *
FROM news
WHERE category = 'b'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
Finally, cap the results to only 20:

SELECT *
FROM news
WHERE category = 'b'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 20;

In this code challenge, the category column values are abbreviated as ‘b’ for ‘Business’ and ‘t’ for ‘Technology’. Should we always abbreviate column values like the category column?
