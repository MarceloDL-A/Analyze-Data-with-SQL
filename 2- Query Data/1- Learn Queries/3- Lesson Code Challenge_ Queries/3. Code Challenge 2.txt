Click here for the table diagram.

Select only the name column.

Checkpoint 2 Passed

Hint
First, find all the distinct names that start with ‘S’:

SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM babies
WHERE name LIKE 'S%';
Notice how the % is placed after ‘S’.

Next, use LIMIT to cap the result to 20:

SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM babies
WHERE name LIKE 'S%'
LIMIT 20;
