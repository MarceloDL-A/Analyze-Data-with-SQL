CODE CHALLENGE: QUERIES
Code Challenge 3
The babies table has the following columns:

name - the name of the baby
year - the year the name was given
gender - the gender of the baby
number - the number of times the name was given
Click here for the table diagram.

Instructions
1.
What are the top 10 names in 1880?

Select the name, gender, and number columns.

Checkpoint 2 Passed

Hint
First, we need to specify the year using a WHERE clause:

SELECT name, gender, number
FROM babies
WHERE year = 1880;
Then, we need to ORDER BY the number of times that name was given. We also need to add DESC so that we start with the most popular names:

SELECT name, gender, number
FROM babies
WHERE year = 1880
ORDER BY number DESC;
Finally, we need to limit our results to the first 10 results:

SELECT name, gender, number
FROM babies
WHERE year = 1880
ORDER BY number DESC
LIMIT 10;

In the context of this code challenge, if there are less than 20 distinct names that start with ‘S’, what happens if our LIMIT value is greater than this?
