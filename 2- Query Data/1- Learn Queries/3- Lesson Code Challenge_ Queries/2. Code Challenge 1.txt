Click here for the table diagram.

Instructions
1.
Find the number of girls who were named Lillian for the full span of time of the database.

Select only the year and number columns.

Checkpoint 2 Passed

Hint
One way is to:

SELECT year, number
FROM babies
WHERE name = 'Lillian';
If you want to be more specific and make the gender is ‘F’:

SELECT year, number
FROM babies
WHERE name = 'Lillian' AND gender = 'F';
Remember, AND combine multiple conditions and make the result set more specific:
