Practice Queries: RPA Fraud DetectionBrief
Objective
QUERY DATA
RPA Fraud Detection
Reputable Product Agency (RPA) has started receiving complaints from their credit card processor about fraudulent transactions. Help your finance department identify potentially risky transactions before they finish processing.

This dataset contains a single table, transaction_data.

The schema of this table is available here.

Write the following queries:
1.
Start by getting a feel for the transaction_data table:

SELECT *
FROM transaction_data
LIMIT 10;
What are the column names?


Hint
Using LIMIT caps the number of rows in the result.

It is a simple way to keep queries from taking too long to run if you are dealing with a big dataset.

The transaction_data table has the following column names:

id
full_name
email
zip
ip_address
2.
The finance department noted that some of the fraudulent transactions were recorded as coming from Smokey Bear’s zip code (20252).

You agree this is suspicious, it’s unlikely that the fire prevention mascot is using Reputable Company’s services.

Find the full_names and emails of the transactions listing 20252 as the zip code.


Hint
SELECT full_name, email, zip
FROM transaction_data
WHERE zip = 20252;
There are 7 transactions from this zip code.

3.
Finance has also noticed a number of pseudonyms associated with fraudulent transactions.

The fraudsters thought it would be funny to use ‘Art Vandelay’ for their full name or add a ‘der’ for their middle name.

Use a query to find the names and emails associated with these transactions.


Hint
SELECT full_name, email
FROM transaction_data
WHERE full_name = 'Art Vandelay'
   OR full_name LIKE '% der %';
We can add a space before and after to search for an individual word: % der %.

If you used %der% instead, you will notice that it will also return names like Sanders and Friederike, which we don’t want because we are looking for a specific middle name.

Remember, OR returns a record if any of the conditions is True:

4.
There are some irregularities in the IP addresses where transactions are originating from.

For example, any IP address beginning with ‘10.’ is reserved for internal use.

We shouldn’t see IP addresses like this accessing Reputable Company’s service.

Find the ip_addresses and emails listed with these transactions.


Hint
The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column:

SELECT ip_address, email
FROM transaction_data
WHERE ip_address LIKE '10.%';
5.
Users are making fraudulent transactions using a temporary email address service. These services provide a short-lived email that can be verified and then self-destructs.

Find the emails in transaction_data with ‘temp_email.com’ as a domain.


Hint
SELECT email
FROM transaction_data
WHERE email LIKE '%temp_email.com';
6.
The finance department is looking for a specific transaction. They know that the transaction occurred from an ip address starting with ‘120.’ and their full name starts with ‘John’.

Can you find the transaction?


Hint
SELECT *
FROM transaction_data
WHERE full_name LIKE 'John%'
  AND ip_address LIKE '120.%';
You found Johnathan’s transaction. Easy!
