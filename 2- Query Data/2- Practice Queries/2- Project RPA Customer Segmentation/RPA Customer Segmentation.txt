Practice Queries: RPA Customer SegmentationBrief
Objective
QUERY DATA
RPA Customer Segmentation
The marketing department of Reputable Product Agency (RPA) is looking to segment the company users by a number of different criteria.

In this context, a segment is a subset of users that meet different conditions. Segments are used to send marketing campaigns to users who meet specific criteria or to measure the performance of specific marketing campaigns.

Use SQL queries to generate user lists for the marketing department. The users dataset is imported into the workspace.

The schema of the table is available here.

Write the following queries:
1.
Start by getting a feel for the users table:

SELECT *
FROM users
LIMIT 20;
What are the column names?


Hint
Using LIMIT caps the number of rows in the result.

The column names are:

id
email
campaign
test
created_at
birthday
2.
The marketing department wants to send a Born in the ‘80s email to the appropriate users.

Find the email addresses and birthdays of users whose birthday is between 1980-01-01 and 1989-12-31.


Hint
Take a look at the table schema. Notice that the birthday column is actually a TEXT column.

No sweat, there are still ways to find users who are born in the 80’s!

SELECT email, birthday
FROM users
WHERE birthday >= '1980-01-01'
  AND birthday <= '1989-12-31';
SELECT email, birthday
FROM users
WHERE birthday BETWEEN '1980-01-01' AND '1989-12-31';
Interesting, so comparison operators can actually work with the TEXT data type.

3.
We are interested in the cohort of users that signed up prior to May 2017.

Find the emails and creation date of users whose created_at date matches this condition.


Hint
There are two ways to do this.

One way is to filter using < May 1st:

SELECT email, created_at
FROM users
WHERE created_at < '2017-05-01';
Another way is to use <= April 30th:

SELECT email, created_at
FROM users
WHERE created_at <= '2017-04-30';
4.
There was an A/B test performed on users that used cute animal clipart to encourage users to sign up. We’d like to see how the group that was shown ‘bears’ is performing.

Find the emails of the users who received the ‘bears’ test.


Hint
SELECT email
FROM users
WHERE test = 'bears';
5.
A total of 4 advertising campaigns were run over this period.

There were two sets of ad copy (set 1 and set 2) and both were run on two search engine sites (AAA and BBB).

The resulting campaign values are:

AAA-1
AAA-2
BBB-1
BBB-2
Find all the emails of all users who received a campaign on website BBB.


Hint
The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

SELECT email
FROM users
WHERE campaign LIKE 'BBB%';
6.
Find all the emails of all users who received ad copy 2 in their campaign.


Hint
SELECT email
FROM users
WHERE campaign LIKE '%-2';
7.
Find the emails for all users who received both a campaign and a test.

These users will have non-empty entries in the campaign and test columns.


Hint
The IS NOT NULL condition is used to test for a non-NULL value.

SELECT email
FROM users
WHERE campaign IS NOT NULL
  AND test IS NOT NULL;
