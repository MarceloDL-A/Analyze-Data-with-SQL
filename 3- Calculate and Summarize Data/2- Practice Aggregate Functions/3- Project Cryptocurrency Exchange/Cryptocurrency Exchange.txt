Objective
CALCULATE AND SUMMARIZE DATA
Cryptocurrency Exchange
Fiddy Cent is a digital currency exchange headquartered in Neo Tokyo. They broker exchanges of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Litecoin with fiat currencies in around 50 countries.

Help them analyze their January ledger data using SQL aggregate functions! You are given the transactions table, which contains both money-in and money-out transactions.

Let’s get started!

Write the following queries:
1.
Let’s start by checking out the whole transactions table:

SELECT *
FROM transactions;
What are the column names?


Hint
transactions has the following columns:

id
user_id
date
currency
money_in
money_out
2.
The money_in column records the amount (in USD) the user bought.

What is the total money_in in the table?


Hint
SELECT SUM(money_in)
FROM transactions;
3.
The money_out column records the amount (in USD) the user sold.

What is the total money_out in the table?


Hint
SELECT SUM(money_out)
FROM transactions;
4.
It was reported that Bitcoin dominates Fiddy Cent’s exchange. Let’s see if it is true within these dates by answering two questions:

How many money_in transactions are in this table?
How many money_in transactions are in this table where ‘BIT’ is the currency?

Hint
We can answer these two questions with two queries:

SELECT COUNT(money_in)
FROM transactions;

SELECT COUNT(money_in)
FROM transactions
WHERE currency = 'BIT';
Out of 43 different money_in transactions, 21 of them are with Bitcoin!

5.
What was the largest transaction in this whole table?

Was it money_in or money_out?


Hint
SELECT MAX(money_in)
FROM transactions;

SELECT MAX(money_out)
FROM transactions;
The largest transaction was a substantial money_out transaction of $15,047 USD!

6.
What is the average money_in in the table for the currency Ethereum (‘ETH’)?


Hint
SELECT AVG(money_in)
FROM transactions
WHERE currency = 'ETH';
7.
Let’s build a ledger for the different dates.

Select date, average money_in, and average money_out from the table.

And group everything by date.


Hint
SELECT date, 
   AVG(money_in), 
   AVG(money_out)
FROM transactions
GROUP BY date;
8.
To make the previous query easier to read, round the averages to 2 decimal places.

Give the column aliases using AS for readability.


Hint
SELECT date, 
   ROUND(AVG(money_in), 2),
   ROUND(AVG(money_out), 2)
FROM transactions
GROUP BY date;
SELECT date AS 'Date', 
   ROUND(AVG(money_in), 2) AS 'Average Buy',
   ROUND(AVG(money_out), 2) AS 'Average Sell'
FROM transactions
GROUP BY date;

  SELECT date, ROUND(AVG(money_in)) AS 'Monei_in', ROUND(AVG(money_out)) AS 'monei_out'
 FROM transactions
 GROUP BY date
 ;
