AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS

Congratulations!

You just learned how to use aggregate functions to perform calculations on your data. What can we generalize so far?

COUNT(): count the number of rows
SUM(): the sum of the values in a column
MAX()/MIN(): the largest/smallest value
AVG(): the average of the values in a column
ROUND(): round the values in the column
Aggregate functions combine multiple rows together to form a single value of more meaningful information.

GROUP BY is a clause used with aggregate functions to combine data from one or more columns.
HAVING limit the results of a query based on an aggregate property.
Instructions
Feel free to experiment a bit more with the fake_apps table before moving on!
