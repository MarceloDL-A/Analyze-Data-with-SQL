Aggregate Functions: Max / MinNarrative and Instructions

AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS
Max / Min
The MAX() and MIN() functions return the highest and lowest values in a column, respectively.

How many downloads does the most popular app have?

SELECT MAX(downloads)
FROM fake_apps;
The most popular app has 31,090 downloads!

MAX() takes the name of a column as an argument and returns the largest value in that column. Here, we returned the largest value in the downloads column.

MIN() works the same way but it does the exact opposite; it returns the smallest value.

Instructions
1.
What is the least number of times an app has been downloaded?

In the code editor, type:

SELECT MIN(downloads)
FROM fake_apps;
Checkpoint 2 Passed

Hint
1,387 downloads.

2.
Delete the previous query.

Write a new query that returns the price of the most expensive app.

Checkpoint 3 Passed

Hint
SELECT MAX(price)
FROM fake_apps;
$14.99 is the price of the most expensive app.
