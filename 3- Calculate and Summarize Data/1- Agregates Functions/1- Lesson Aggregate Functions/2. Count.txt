Count
The fastest way to calculate how many rows are in a table is to use the COUNT() function.

COUNT() is a function that takes the name of a column as an argument and counts the number of non-empty values in that column.

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM table_name;
Here, we want to count every row, so we pass * as an argument inside the parenthesis.

Instructions
1.
Let’s count how many apps are in the table.

In the code editor, run:

SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM fake_apps;
Checkpoint 2 Passed

Hint
There are 200 apps.

Common errors:

Missing parenthesis.
Missing ;.
2.
Add a WHERE clause in the previous query to count how many free apps are in the table.

Checkpoint 3 Passed

Hint
Remember the WHERE statement?

The following code should go inside the previous query, before the semicolon:

SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM fake_apps
WHERE price = 0;
WHERE indicates we want to only include rows where the following condition is true.
price = 0 is the condition.
There are 73 free apps in the table.
