Average
SQL uses the AVG() function to quickly calculate the average value of a particular column.

The statement below returns the average number of downloads for an app in our database:

SELECT AVG(downloads)
FROM fake_apps;
The AVG() function works by taking a column name as an argument and returns the average value for that column.

Instructions
1.
Calculate the average number of downloads for all the apps in the table.

In the code editor, type:

SELECT AVG(downloads)
FROM fake_apps;
Checkpoint 2 Passed

Hint
16,613.8 average downloads.

2.
Remove the previous query.

Write a new query that calculates the average price for all the apps in the table.

Checkpoint 3 Passed

Hint
Which column should go inside the parenthesis?

 SELECT AVG(_____)
 FROM fake_apps;
The average price is $2.02365.
