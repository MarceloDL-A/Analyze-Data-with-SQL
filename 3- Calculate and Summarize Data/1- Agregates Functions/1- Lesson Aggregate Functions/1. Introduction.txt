AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS
Introduction
We’ve learned how to write queries to retrieve information from the database. Now, we are going to learn how to perform calculations using SQL.

Calculations performed on multiple rows of a table are called aggregates.

In this lesson, we have given you a table named fake_apps which is made up of fake mobile applications data.

Here is a quick preview of some important aggregates that we will cover in the next five exercises:

COUNT(): count the number of rows
SUM(): the sum of the values in a column
MAX()/MIN(): the largest/smallest value
AVG(): the average of the values in a column
ROUND(): round the values in the column
Let’s get started!

Instructions
1.
Before getting started, take a look at the data in the fake_apps table.

In the code editor, type the following:

SELECT *
FROM fake_apps;
What are the column names?
