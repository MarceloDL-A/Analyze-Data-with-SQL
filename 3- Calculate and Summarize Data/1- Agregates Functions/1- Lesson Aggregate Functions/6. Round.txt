AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS
Round
By default, SQL tries to be as precise as possible without rounding. We can make the result table easier to read using the ROUND() function.

ROUND() function takes two arguments inside the parenthesis:

a column name
an integer
It rounds the values in the column to the number of decimal places specified by the integer.

SELECT ROUND(price, 0)
FROM fake_apps;
Here, we pass the column price and integer 0 as arguments. SQL rounds the values in the column to 0 decimal places in the output.

Instructions
1.
Let’s return the name column and a rounded price column.

In the code editor, type:

SELECT name, ROUND(price, 0)
FROM fake_apps;
Checkpoint 2 Passed

Hint
We are selecting ROUND(price, 0) as the second column in this query.

2.
Remove the previous query.

In the last exercise, we were able to get the average price of an app ($2.02365) using this query:

SELECT AVG(price)
FROM fake_apps;
Now, let’s edit this query so that it rounds this result to 2 decimal places.

This is a tricky one!

Checkpoint 3 Passed

Hint
You can treat AVG(price) just like any other value and place it inside the ROUND function like so:

ROUND(AVG(price), 2)
Here, AVG(price) is the 1st argument and 2 is the 2nd argument because we want to round it to two decimal places:

SELECT ROUND(AVG(price), 2)
FROM fake_apps;
