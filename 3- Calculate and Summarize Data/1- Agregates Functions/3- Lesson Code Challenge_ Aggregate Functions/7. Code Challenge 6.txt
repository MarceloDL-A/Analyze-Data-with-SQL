Checkpoint 2 Passed

Hint
Use the SUM() and ROUND() functions with the watch_history table.

You can treat SUM(watch_duration_in_minutes) just like any other value and place it inside the ROUND() function like so:

ROUND(SUM(watch_duration_in_minutes), 0)
Here, SUM(watch_duration_in_minutes) is the 1st argument and 0 is the 2nd argument because we want to round it to zero decimal places:

SELECT ROUND(SUM(watch_duration_in_minutes), 0) 
FROM watch_history;
