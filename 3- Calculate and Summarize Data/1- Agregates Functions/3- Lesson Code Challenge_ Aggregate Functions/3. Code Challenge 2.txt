Code Challenge 2
The users table has the following columns:

id
first_name
last_name
email
password
Click here for the table diagram.

Instructions
1.
What are the most popular first names on Codeflix?

Use COUNT(), GROUP BY, and ORDER BY to create a list of first names and occurrences within the users table.

Order the data so that the most popular names are displayed first.

Checkpoint 2 Passed

Hint
When you select the count of users, make sure to rename it:

SELECT first_name, COUNT(*) AS 'count'
FROM users
GROUP BY first_name
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
This way, after you GROUP BY first_name, you can use ORDER BY to sort the data by the count variable.

Also, because we want to display the most popular names first, DESC is needed!
